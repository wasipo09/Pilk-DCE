## Analysis & Decision

**Direction: BEARISH**

**NOT TO PLAY**

**Reason:** Bearish market conditions with options signaling caution makes a high-strike OTM call a risky bet. The $82K call is too expensive ($5) for a market that just hit multi-month lows and shows no conviction.

**Discipline:** Sitting out when conditions don't align — this is how we protect the bankroll and wait for better setups.
