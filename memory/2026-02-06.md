# Directive Update - 2026-02-06 13:10 ICT

## Coding Tooling Directive
Kaname specified that when using subagents for coding tasks, I must instruct them to use **codex CLI** and **claude code** as their primary tools. This is now the preferred approach for all coding work.

Updated MEMORY.md to reflect:
- Coding subagents should always be told to use `codex` CLI and `claude code`
- These are the preferred tools for complex projects, trading tools, visualizations, etc.
- Lesson from Pilk-OCV updated to mention Codex specifically

This applies to all future coding subagent spawns via `sessions_spawn`.

## News
- CoinDesk: Bitcoin slid through $68K and briefly tested the low-$60K range before Asia buying flushed $700M of liquidations and popped the price back toward $65K—major macro risk-off still intact, but short-term whipsaw is very real.
- Cointelegraph: BTC broke a 2026 support at $73K, printing a new multi-week low, though the tone is more "normalizing" than panic; veterans say these dips are part of the cycle rather than a structural breakdown.
- Bitcoin Magazine: The decline toward $59K marked Bitcoin’s largest dollar drawdown ever, highlighting the sheer size of the liquidation wave and reminding the desk that volatility is running hot.
- Decrypt: Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have surrendered nearly all their 2026 gains as fading Fed rate-cut hopes knock outflows past $1.7B—liquidity keeps shrinking while macro eyes stay glued to Powell.
- The Block: Bernstein still expects the current bear leg to flip in 1H 2026 with a bottom near the prior cycle highs (~$60K), suggesting this sell-off could be the last capitulation before the next leg higher.

## Options Data
- Ran `python3 lotto_scanner.py --days 7 --cost 5 --json`; combined Deribit/Binance scan printed BTC spot ~ $65,440 and exported `lotto_scan_best_plays_20260206_121713.json` for reference.
- Deribit GEX walls stack up around 65K/66K (call + put heavy) and put pressure above at 67K/70K—gamma is still concentrated near the 65-70K band, so any breakout beyond that band would need a gamma-assisted squeeze.
- Binance G/T scan still ranks the 06FEB call 71K near the top of the list, but the expiry is under 24h, so we scoped out the next highest scores for expiries ≥ 07FEB26 and found the 78K 07FEB26 call (score 62.2, +19% OTM, mark ~$5, IV ~118%).

## Play
- Direction: neutral/bearish macro; we are holding a lotto-sized upside call to capture any bounce that pokes past the heavy gamma cluster without leaning on a full bull thesis.
- Recommendation: Long CALL $78K 07FEB26, entry ~$5, max loss ~$500, because it is far OTM, sits beyond the >24h window, and a short squeeze through the 70K wall could spike option value quickly.

## News
- Cointelegraph flagged miners IREN and CleanSpark shares plunging after earnings misses, while the broader crypto sentiment gauge is the weakest since the 2022 crash as BTC tests the low-$60K range — the tape is still risk-off.
- Decrypt's "Does Bitcoin's retreat signal a new bear market?" story plus ETF outflow headlines keep liquidity squeezed, even as Kalshi's Super Bowl surveillance build, OpenAI vs Anthropic model launches, and Pump.fun acquiring Vyper provide the few bullish tidbits.
- Scraper snapshot: 3 bullish / 8 bearish headlines, so overall bias remains bearish heading into the 12:21 window.

## Options Data
- Run `python3 lotto_scanner.py --days 14 --cost 5 --json` captured 212 Deribit rows + 161 Binance rows; BTC spot ~ $65.5K, Deribit GEX call/put walls still centered around 65-70K (calls at 65/70/66/67/75, puts at 65/67/70/66/64) so gamma stays trapped near the prior floor/ceiling band.
- Binance best-call list now highlights expiries out to 20FEB26 (64K 13FEB, 80-86K 20FEB) but many far expiries carry wider spreads, so we stressed the dataset for options with expiry ≥ 07FEB26 plus tighter bid/ask depth.
- Best far-OTM fit is the 76K 20FEB26 call: call gamma rent ~4.57e-07, IV ~61%, dist +16%, WW band ~0.0037, bid/ask 425/440, mark ~439.9, spread $15 (~3.4% of mark) and still well outside the 24h window (Feb 20 expiry).

## Far-OTM Play
- Candidate: Long CALL 76K 20FEB26 (BBO 425/440, mark ~$440). Spread is just $15, gamma sensitivity is solid, and it sits outside the 24h window while a rally through 70K could reprice the payoff sharply. Keep it lotto-sized and avoid chasing tighter strikes while gamma remains stacked around 65-70K.
