## Lotto Scanner Updates

### Issues Fixed
- **Premium calculation error** — User corrected me that 69000 CALL 06FEB26 was not $0.01 but actually ~$1,880. Fixed by using correct Binance data source.
- **IV collapse alerting** — IV dropped from 78.9% to 68.9% (-12.6%), then spiked to 93%. Monitoring IV for lotto plays.

### Lotto Plays Analyzed (Feb 5)

**Current Position:**
- 74000 PUT 06FEB26 @ $2,863 (0.01 contracts = $28.63 exposure)
- ITM position (intrinsic: ~$2,539), near put GEX wall
- Target: Break above 75K (stop loss), profit if BTC < 70K

**Key Scanner Results:**
- **BTC Price:** $70,377.27 (Feb 5, 19:00)
- **Net GEX:** +$5.4M (positive) → call squeeze potential
- **Best Play (Scanner):** 79000 CALL 06FEB26 @ $748.90 (13.9% OTM)
- **Alternative Plays:**
  - 74000 PUT 06FEB26 @ $3,727 (ATM-ITM, near put GEX)
  - 75000 CALL 06FEB26 @ $328.8 (near GEX zone)
  - 76000 CALL 06FEB26 @ $200 (cheapest OTM)

### Pilk-OCV Analysis (7FEB26)

**GEX Zones:**
- 70K: Massive put wall (-807K net GEX) — strong support
- 72K: Put GEX zone (-665K net) — downside risk
- 78K: Strong call GEX wall (+1.68M net) — upside squeeze target

**IV Skew:**
- ATM ~79%, puts slightly more expensive OTM → defensive positioning
- Upside IV 77.89%, downside 80.82% — elevated volatility expectations

**Directional Bias:** NEUTRAL-LEANING-BULLISH
- Massive 70K floor + bullish 78K-80K walls = call squeeze setup
- However, recent dump to 72K makes this risky

### Pilk Automation Setup

**New Cron Jobs Created (Feb 5):**
1. **Pilk Maintenance (1:00 AM ICT)** — Runs pilk-gh-status, adds features/optimizations to stale repos
2. **Pilk Maintenance Report (8:00 AM ICT)** — Reviews overnight work, sends daily summary

**Pilk-GH-Status Update:**
- Updated to use dynamic GitHub scanning instead of hard-coded REPO_REGISTRY
- Now fetches Pilk repos via `gh repo list` command
- Tested and working ✅

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor 74K PUT position (current: +5.1%)
- Look for BTC bounce above 71K to confirm bullish bias
- If BTC holds 70K-72K, consider 75000 CALL for upside hedge
- First maintenance run: Feb 6, 1:00 AM (1:00-7:00 window)

---

**Summary:**
- User corrected my premium math error → more careful with Binance data
- IV collapsed then spiked — monitor for lotto opportunities
- Automation fully set up → ready for maintenance tonight
- Lotto: NOT TO PLAY (bearish fundamentals vs positive GEX)
